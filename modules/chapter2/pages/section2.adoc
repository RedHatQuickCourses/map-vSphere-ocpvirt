OpenShift Virtualization allows virtual machines to take full advantage of cloud-native automation tools - ArgoCD (GitOps), Tekton (pipelines), Red Hat Advanced Cluster Manager (multi-cluster management).
OpenShift embraces the _infrastructure as code_ model, in which the OpenShift infrastructure itself (not just workloads) are managed in a declarative fashion.
