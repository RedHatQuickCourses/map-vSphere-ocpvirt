[IMPORTANT]
This is not a feature comparison list. This is a tool to help map features and capabilities from the old platform to the new. The goal is not to have a feature-by-feature comparison, rather to get past the basic “will this meet my needs” conversation so that the customer can move into a workshop, followed by a pilot.
