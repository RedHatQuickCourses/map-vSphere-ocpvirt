= Alternate View: How to connect VMs and containers/k8s?

== VMware
* Kubernetes is deployed in VMs to the vSphere environment
* When using standard networking, e.g. (D)vSwitches, for VM connectivity, Pod-to-VM traffic traverses the k8s ingress/egress stack
* When using NSX-T as the SDN, VMs and containers can be connected to the same logical network
* Additional functionality, e.g. microsegmentation, for Pods relies on NSX-T

== OpenShift Virtualization
* OpenShift Virtualization uses the same SDN for both Pods and VMs, they are native peers.
* VMs access the same SDN features as Pods, including network policies, Service Mesh, Service and Route abstractions, etc.
* VMs can also connect directly to external L2 network, e.g. VLAN, or other networks defined using Multus
